    <h1 id="Name">Dr. Vinod Balachandran</h1>
        <span>I am a surgical oncologist with special training in surgery to treat people for both benign (non-cancerous) and cancerous diseases of the pancreas, bile duct, gallbladder, and liver. I also research new ways to treat pancreatic cancer using the immune system. I have dedicated my career to providing exceptional care for people with pancreatic cancer, and bring deep experience, knowledge, and a relentless commitment to my patients to achieve this.I first came to Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center (MSK) in 2006 as a young surgeon. The teamwork, determination, and passion to solve every problem for every patient was inspiring and unlike anything I had ever experienced. I knew MSK was extraordinary, and that I would be privileged to join its mission to end cancer for life.

I bring the same intensity, determination, and dedication to every surgery I perform, and every patient I care for. Pancreatic cancer is one of the most complex and difficult diseases to treat and requires the experience of a highly specialized surgical team. At MSK, our team brings deep expertise. For every patient, we follow the MSK philosophy – do it once, do it right, and do it efficiently – from diagnosis to treatment to recovery. We also recognize that every person is unique and commit our team’s full resources to meeting their needs.

In addition to performing surgeries and caring for patients, I run a research laboratory in the Immuno-Oncology Program at MSK. Here, my team is working to discover new ways to activate the immune system to treat pancreatic cancer. We are also working to convert these discoveries into new medicines that help patients. To achieve these goals rapidly, I helped found and direct The Olayan Center for Cancer Vaccines, an academic research center designed to speed up laboratory discoveries into new immunotherapies for patients.   </span>
